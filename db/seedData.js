Ensor dressed skeletons up in his studio and arranged them in colorful, enigmatic tableaux on the canvas, and used masks as a theatrical aspect in his still life paintings. Attracted by masks’ plastic forms, bright colors, and potential for psychological impact, he created a format in which he could paint with complete freedom. For Ensor, while the mask hides the identity of individuals it nevertheless exposes the wearer’s true personality – malicious, giddy, foolish. It is not, in this sense, a mask at all. “Masks” is one of the finest represenations of Ensor’s work.',
